The page object model (pom) is where you tell Maven the relevant information about your maven project. Points of interst:

-properties
    this is where we tell Maven what version of Java we are using
-dependencies
this is where we tell Maven the third party libraries we want to integrate into our project
-build
this is where we can add plugins to our project that affect the way Maven builds our application
a common use-case is to use the maven-surefire-plugin so that maven will only build the application if all tests associated with the project pass
